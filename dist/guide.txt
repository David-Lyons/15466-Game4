Call the guard and knock him out. If you look around first, you can knock him out with a rock, but that's not important. 
Turning left gets you a sword and shovel while turning right gets you to the guards. If you have the rock or shovel, 
you can throw it as a distraction to get by the guards. You can also return to your cell with the shovel and dig your way
out. Finally, you can use the sword to get past the guards, but that will injure you. In any case, you'll reach the coast.

Turning left gets you to the TTC easter egg, as well as a key. If you then retrace your steps and go right, the key can free
your buddy. If you turn right, you get to more guards. In order to beat the guards, you need a sword, and you either need to
be uninjured or have your buddy. Then, you reach the ship and win. Alternatively, if you go past your buddy into the deep
woods, you can turn left to grab an oar and then turn right to reach a raft, which can also free you from the island.
